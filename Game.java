/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Westeros" application.
 *  "Westeros" is a text based adventure game, inspired by the
 *  book series 'A song of Ice and Fire' and television series
 *  'Game of Thrones' written by George R.R Martin and produced by HBO.
 *
 *  Names of some characters, locations and the name of the game 'Westeros'
 *  are inspired by 'A song of Ice and Fire'. The storyline of the game however,
 *  is my own work.
 *
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 *
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, NPCs, items; creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
